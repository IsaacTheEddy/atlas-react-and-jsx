      <p>
        My name is Isaac Edwards, and My spec at atlas is Full-Stack Web
        Development. I am currnetly on my Final Trimeseter (Trimester 5) and I
        am nervous but also very confident in my title as a Software Engineer.
        I've enjoyed working with various technologies like Python, MySQL, and
        Web Development. One of my favorite languages is most definetily
        JavaScript. It has really grown on me. After my time here at Atlas, I
        would love to enter the AeroSpace field and develop and learn
        interesting things I that field. And if noe tareospace then Biology
        would be an interesting field to study. While im not doing anything work
        related I enjoy being outside and part of the community in as many ways
        as I can. From random conventions and expos to riding my electric and
        non-electric skate board at Riverside. I just enjoy moving around which
        some might see a conflict in my personal life and software related
        activites. But I feel as though im right where I should to be and going
        in the right direction.
